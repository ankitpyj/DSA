Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.
Note: Alphanumeric characters consist of letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9).

Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
Output: true


class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        cleaned =""

        for ch in s:
            if ch.isalnum():
                cleaned += ch.lower()

        return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]
