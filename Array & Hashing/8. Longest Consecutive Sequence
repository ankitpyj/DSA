Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.
Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]
Output: 4




class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set =set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in num_set:

            if num-1 not in num_set:
                length=1
                current= num

                while current+1 in num_set:
                    current +=1 
                    length+=1

                longest = max (longest,length)

        return longest
